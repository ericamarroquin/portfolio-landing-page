  <h2>About Me</h2>
  <p>Hi! My name is Erica Marroquin and I'm currently a student at Epicodus. I have a background in environmental engineering and previous work experience as a project engineer for a general contractor in New York City. Although fun to work on huge infrastructure projects, I decided to make the change to programming to challenge myself and pursue a long-time interest. I recently relocated to Portland, OR to attend Epicodus and for a change of pace. I'm excited to start this adventure!</p>
  
  <h3>Interests and Hobbies</h3>
  <p>I'm an <strong>avid</strong> knitter and crafter in general - check out my fiber-arts Instagram <a href="https://instagram.com/hardhatknits">here</a>! I love a good drama series, with bonus points if it's long running. I'm on a constant pursuit to make the best asian-style cuisine I can, as I enjoy cooking and trying new recipes. If not doing any of the above, I'm probably lifting weights!</p>

  <h3>Skills</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>HTML</li>
    <li>CSS</li>
    <li>Git and GitHub</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Programming Interests</h3>
  <p>During my time in school, I had the chance to do a bit of programming for my classes and research. I was able to learn about some topics that I enjoy:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Data manipulation</li>
    <li>Back-end programming</li>
  </ol>
  <p>I hope to learn more about what I like during my time at Epicodus and beyond!</p>

    <span class="thin"><h3>My Favorite Band</h3></span>
    <p>This is a webpage showing my favorite music artist, SZA, and some information about her. This uses HTML and CSS for styling. This project helped me learn <em>span</em>, as I toyed a lot with the background color of text. The styling of some album art emulated the 'old school Google' look, so I tried to recreate the look of <span class="highlight"> highlighting text in a browser.</span> You can find the GitHub repository <a href="https://github.com/ericamarroquin/favorite-band">here</a>.</p>

    <span class="thin"><h3>My Dream Vacation</h3></span>
    <p>This webpage goes into detail about my dream vacation, Cancun. This uses HTML and Bootstrap for styling, with an additional CSS stylesheet for more customization. The Github repository can be found <a href="https://github.com/ericamarroquin/vacation-site">here</a>.</p>
