    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>Hi! My name is Erica Marroquin and I'm currently a student at Epicodus. I have a background in environmental engineering and previous work experience as a project engineer for a general contractor in New York City. Although fun to work on huge infrastructure projects, I decided to make the change to programming to challenge myself and pursue a long-time interest. I recently relocated to Portland, OR to attend Epicodus and for a change of pace. I'm excited to start this adventure!</p>
      
    <h3>Interests and Hobbies</h3>
    <p>I'm an <strong>avid</strong> knitter and crafter in general - check out my fiber-arts Instagram <a href="https://instagram.com/hardhatknits">here</a>! I love a good drama series, with bonus points if it's long running. I'm on a constant pursuit to make the best asian-style cuisine I can, as I enjoy cooking and trying new recipes. If not doing any of the above, I'm probably lifting weights!</p>

    <h3>Skills</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>HTML</li>
      <li>CSS</li>
      <li>Git and GitHub</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Programming Interests</h3>
    <p>During my time in school, I had the chance to do a bit of programming for my classes and research. I was able to learn about some topics that I enjoy:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Data manipulation</li>
      <li>Back-end programming</li>
    </ol>
    <p>I hope to learn more about what I like during my time at Epicodus and beyond!</p>
